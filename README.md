# JSFTemplating

Jakarta Faces VDL/Templating library to create reusable UI components.

JSFTemplating is an alternative VDL (View Description Language) for Jakarta Faces. It replaces Facelets or the (now deprecated) Jakarta Server Pages.
Practically, JSTTemplating is only used by the GlassFish admin console. It's solely retained for keeping that working, and therefor JSFTemplating is 
absolutely not recommended to be used for new development of any kind.


## Build

```bash
$ mvn install
```
